# Project Overview - NGTG®

Next Gentrification Target Generator®

Challenge: find the next neighborhood to be gentrified.

We went out to check if there is a connection between environmental indicators and the transformation of neighbourhoods from a low social status to a higher one over time.

Using data from Berlin.de - the data was collected as a part of the “Berlin Umweltkarte” project.

data source: berlin.de/umweltkarte/

# Data Acquisition & Database Design
The data had to be cleaned, names and measurements standardized.
I had trouble with the different neighborhood names - at some point the planning areas map was redrawn - names and population numbers changed.
So I only used data from before that.
The database was made from couple of tables - each with the same categories for different years.

# conclusion
A connection between environmental indicators and increase in social status was found:

we can build a system to recommend neighborhoods for long term investment
